# Proxy.sol

My contracts are crafted in Yul (Solidity Assembly) for efficient gas fees and enhanced memory handling. Each function is streamlined for simplicity, preventing unnecessary complexity. For further details, reach out to me via LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/aloycwl/.

All the variations of different proxies will be stored here.
